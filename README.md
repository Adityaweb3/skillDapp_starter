Blockchain-based skill verification will be an ideal solution to this problem as it provides a transparent, trustworthy, and independent platform that also reduces the time spent on conducting competency checks. With blockchain, any user can enter their details regarding skills, certifications, and work experience and get those details verified by their respective company coworkers, managers, and team leaders with complete transparency.
It  provides every user with a unique id. It will be straightforward to verify the qualifications of any candidate, as each one of their skills will have its own list of linked certifications and endorsements. Skills will also get a verified badge once endorsed by the managers/employers of their current company.
